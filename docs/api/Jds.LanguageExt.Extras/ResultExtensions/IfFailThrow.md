# ResultExtensions.IfFailThrow&lt;TSuccess&gt; method

Gets the value of *result*, throwing an InvalidOperationException if it is a failure.

```csharp
public static TSuccess IfFailThrow<TSuccess>(this Result<TSuccess> result)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| TSuccess | A success type. |
| result | A Result. |

## Return Value

The success value in *result*.

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| BottomException | Thrown when *result* is in a Bottom state. |

## Remarks

This method supports testing. Specifically, since test runners treat uncaught exceptions as test failures, `IfFailThrow` can be used within test methods to unpack test arrangement results and fail the test if an Exception occurred during the arranged workflow (which resulted in *result*).
